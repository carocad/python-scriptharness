Scriptharness
=============

Scriptharness is a framework for writing scripts.  There are three core principles: full logging, flexible configuration, and modular actions.  The goal of `full logging` is to be able to debug problems purely through the log.  The goal of `flexible configuration` is to make each script useful in a variety of contexts and environments.  The goals of `modular actions` are a) faster development feedback loops and b) different workflows for different usage requirements.
