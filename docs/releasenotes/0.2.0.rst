=================================

**UNRELEASED**

.. :date: DATE

Changelog for the unreleased 0.2.0 version.

What's New
----------
* More ways to enable and disable actions.  Now, in addition to ``--actions``, there's ``--add-actions``, ``--skip-actions``, and ``--action-group`` to change the set of default actions to run.  (See :ref:`Enabling-and-Disabling-Actions`.)

* Added ``Command`` object with cross-platform output_timeout and max_timeout support, with a ``run()`` wrapper function for easier use.  This is for running external tools with timeouts.  (See :ref:`Command-and-run`.)

    * Added ``ScriptHarnessTimeout`` exception

* Added ``ParsedCommand`` subclass of ``Command``.  Also added a ``parse()`` wrapper function for easier use.  This is for running external tools, and parsing the output of those tools to detect errors. (See :ref:`ParsedCommand-and-parse`.)

    * Added ``ErrorList``, ``OutputParser`` objects for ``ParsedCommand`` error parsing.  (See :ref:`ErrorLists-and-OutputParser`.)
    * Added ``OutputBuffer`` object for ``ParsedCommand`` context lines support.  (See :ref:`OutputBuffer-and-context-lines`.)

* Added ``Output`` object with cross-platform output_timeout and max_timeout support.  Also added ``get_output()``, and ``get_text_output()`` wrapper functions for easier use.  This is for capturing the output of an external tool for later use.  (See :ref:`Output-get_output-and-get_text_output`.)

* Added ``ConfigVariable`` and ``ConfigTemplate`` objects for configuration definition and validation support.  See :ref:`Config-Templates`.

* Script.actions is now a namedtuple

* test_config.py no longer hardcodes port 8001.

* Split a number of modules out.

* 100% coverage

* pylint 10.00
