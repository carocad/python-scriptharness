Scriptharness 0.2.0 Release Notes
=================================

**UNRELEASED**

.. :date: DATE

Changelog for the unreleased 0.2.0 version.

What's New
----------
* More ways to enable and disable actions.  Now, in addition to ``--actions``, there's ``--add-actions``, ``--skip-actions``, and ``--action-group`` to change the set of default actions to run.  (See :ref:`Enabling-and-Disabling-Actions`.)

* Added ``Command`` object with cross-platform output_timeout and max_timeout support, with a ``run()`` wrapper function for easier use.  This is for running external tools with timeouts.

    * Added ``ScriptHarnessTimeout`` exception

* Added ``ParsedCommand`` subclass of ``Command``.  Also added a ``parse()`` wrapper function for easier use.  This is for running external tools, and parsing the output of those tools to detect errors.

    * Added ``ErrorList``, ``OutputParser`` objects for ``ParsedCommand`` error parsing.
    * Added ``OutputBuffer`` object for ``ParsedCommand`` context lines support.

* Added ``Output`` object with cross-platform output_timeout and max_timeout support.  Also added ``get_output()``, and ``get_text_output()`` wrapper functions for easier use.  This is for capturing the output of an external tool for later use.

* Script.actions is now a namedtuple

* test_config.py no longer hardcodes port 8001.

* Split a number of modules out.

* 100% coverage

* pylint 10.00

.. note:: If you've cloned python-scriptharness 0.1.0, you may need to remove the ``scriptharness/commands`` directory, as it will conflict with the new ``scriptharness/commands.py`` module.
